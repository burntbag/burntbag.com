### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION

‘Personal Information’ is information that identifies you as an individual. This is only collected by us if you submit it to us directly, for example via email.

**Communications:** We collect and store your email when you sign up to be notified of a game release, or where you nominate to specifically allow our games to collect your player name, for example high score leaderboards. We will also keep your contact details if you contact us for a particular purpose such as support, but will not store this information for any longer than is necessary.

**Disclosure, and Security of Your Information:** We will not disclose any personal information you provide to us for any reason, without your prior consent. Otherwise, your Personal Information will only be disclosed where required by law.
Your Personal Information is stored offsite in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.

### NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION

This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.

**Third Party Services:** This website (https://burntbag.com) uses cookies to collect internet log information and general visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form for the sole purpose of analytics.

**Cookies:** Cookies are files with small amounts of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Like many sites, we use “cookies” to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

#### CHILDREN’S INFORMATION

Burnt Bag Studios does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do everything possible to remove such information from our records.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.
